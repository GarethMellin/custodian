# Custodian
WordPress security is a popular topic for a good reason. Consider: In January 2017 alone, WordFence reported an average of 26 million brute force attacks against WordPress websites per day. In the same report they recorded more complex, targeted attacks at an average of 4.7 million per day for the same time frame.
That’s a lot of people (and bots) up to no good.

So What Does Custodian have to offer.
Custodian totally obfuscates all forms of access to all WordPress login or WP Admin areas they will not be discovered by bots in fact once the pug-in is activated even you wont be able to access your admin area. All attempts to access your install will be redirected to your home page.

To gain access to WP logIn/Admin areas users will first have to visit a preset (hidden) page in their browser, prior to accessing the usual WP logIn/Admin areas in a new tab or browser window. This will then reveal the LogIn forms for a period of two minutes.

Registered (Paying) users have the added protection (dependent on service level) of creating a mobile access only hidden page (within their website). Visiting this page via the smart phone and activating it as a WebApp (simply saving to your home screen) will guarantee access to the registered WP Install.

Ultimate protection is offered by creating an account with us, whereby you access a hidden page on our Custodian Server (via your smart phone EWApp). Entering a predefined password our system opens access to your registered WP install allowing users to gain access to the usual WP Login/Administration areas.
Access is granted for a predetermined time period (presently set to 2 mins).
Custodian effectively gets rid of brute force attacks and delivers a two factor authorisation layer that doesn’t require mobile phone (costs) or e-mail layer to gain access.
